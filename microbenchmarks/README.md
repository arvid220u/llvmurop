Microbenchmarks to verify the correctness and speed of a few small examples of cilk for range loops.

Run:

```
echo 2000 forrange | ./a.out
```

to run the cilk for range daxpy code with 2000 iterations.

Run:

```
echo 2000 for | ./a.out
```

to run the normal cilk for daxpy code with 2000 iterations.
